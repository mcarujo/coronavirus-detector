# Models
In this folder, you can see the models that were tested by me during the development process. This folder and these files created to encapsulate the model definition and automatize the development process.
- *cnn5_ann5_fibonacci_adam* is a CNN with 5 convolutional layers, 5 dense layers, and adam as an optimizer.
- *cnn6_ann3_pow10_adamax* is a CNN with 6 convolutional layers, 3 dense layers, and adam as an optimizer.
- *cnn10_ann2_pow2_adam* is a CNN with 10 convolutional layers, 2 dense layers, and adam as an optimizer.
- *inception_resnet_v2* is a CNN from Keras aplication InceptionResNetV2, to see their docs just click [here](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionresnetv2/).
- *resnet50* is a CNN from Keras aplication ResNet50, to see their docs just click [here](https://keras.io/api/applications/resnet/#resnet50-function).
- *vgg16* is a CNN from Keras aplication VGG16, to see their docs just click [here](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/#vgg16-function).


For each folder, there is a 'readme.md' file showing the (lastest) results for each model.  You can browse through and analyze the results. The file **model.py** inside the folders define the model.
