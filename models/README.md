# Models
In this folder, you can see the models that were tested by me during the development process. This folder and these files created to encapsulate the model definition and automatize the development process.
- *cnn5_ann5_fibonacci_adam* is a CNN with 5 convolutional layers, 5 dense layers, and adam as an optimizer.
- *cnn6_ann3_pow10_adamax* is a CNN with 6 convolutional layers, 3 dense layers, and adam as an optimizer.
- *cnn10_ann2_pow2_adam* is a CNN with 10 convolutional layers, 2 dense layers, and adam as an optimizer.

For each folder, there is a 'readme.md' file showing the (lastest) results for each model.  You can browse through and analyze the results. The file **model.py** inside the folders define the model.
